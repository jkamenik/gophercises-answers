# Gophercises Answers

These are my answers for the https://gophercises.com/.

Each directory houses the answers to what I completed of the exercises.  Generally the `README` will be unchanged so you will need to read the code to figure out what I did and didn't do.  But that is the point.

## Running the code

First, install Go based on your [OS](https://golang.org/doc/install).

Second, use an [editor](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/IDEsAndTextEditorPlugins) that understand go.  I like [Atom](https://atom.io/) with the [go-plus](https://atom.io/packages/go-plus) plugin.

Third, clone the repo: `git clone git@github.com:jkamenik/gophercises-answers.git`

Four, follow the exercise directories.
